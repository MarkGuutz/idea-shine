					<p>Andrew is extremely passionate about cars and about his car in particular. He loves to drive and work on 
					his M3 on the weekend, but he's become so busy with work and other events that he went months not cleaning 
					his car. That's when he contacted us. Now he can spend more time enjoying his car and less time cleaning.
					It was a pleasure working with him and we'd also like to thank him for letting us use his amazing car for 
					some photos for this site.</p>

			<div class="divider"></div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="waterless-1">Do you still use water?</h3>
				<p>Yes, but we use 95% less water than a traditional car wash. Our waterless wash uses less than a gallon of water 
				versus a typical car wash in your driveway that can use up to 100 gallons of water.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="waterless-2">Why do you use waterless products?</h3>
				<p>Due to the severity of the current drought in California, we wanted to reduce our water use, but still be able
				deliver high quality detailing services. After countless hours researching products and techniques, we are proud
				to have found a way to meet the needs of our customers and the environment.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="waterless-3">Will I receive the same quality with waterless wash?</h3>
				<p>Yes, we decided to use waterless solutions because we found that it didn't reduce the quality of the wash. The
				waterless product that we use has a built in wax and clay, which does not harm the paint. We would not use any product
				on our customers' vehicles that we wouldn't use on our own!</p>

				<h3 id="appointment-1">How does requesting an appointment online work?</h3>
				<p>After you complete the online appointment request, we will contact you within 24 hours to confirm the details of your
				appointment. Due to the variety of vehicle sizes, the amount of time to detail a vehicle will vary and we also want to confirm the price based on the vehicle segment to avoid confusion. 
				That is why our follow up also consits of confirming the location, date, and time. If there is a scheduliing conflict, we will work with you to set up an alternate date and time.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="appointment-2">What happens during the appointment?</h3>
				<p>We will meet at the location, date, and time that you specified. We do
				a walkaround before the wash. After that you can go relax, while we detail your car. We will contact you once we are finished and
				you can take a look at your shiny vehicle.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="appointment-3"> Should I remove all my belongings inside prior to the appointment? </h3>
				<p> Yes, please remove all your belongings inside the car before we begin to detail the vehicle. The reason we ask to have all items
				removed is to reduce the chances of things being misplaced or damaged. If all belongings are removed before the appointment, we can
				begin without delay.
				</p> 
			</div>
			<div class="q-a-container">
				<h3 id="appointment-4">What form of payments do you accept?</h3>
				<p> We currently only accept cash, but are planning to accept credit cards in the future. We will update this site and customers once 
				that option becomes available.
